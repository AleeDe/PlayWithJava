Subject: Application for One Month Leave for Religious Pilgrimage

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to formally request a one-month leave of absence from college, starting from August 15, 2024, to September 15, 2024, to visit the holy place of Karbala in Iraq for performing Ziyarat.

As a devout follower, this pilgrimage holds significant spiritual importance for me, and it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fulfill my religious duties. I assure you that I will make every effort to catch up on any missed lessons and assignments during my absence.

I kindly request your understanding and approval for this leave. I am confident that this experience will enrich my spiritual and personal growth, and I will return with renewed focus and dedication towards my studies.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours sincerely,

Aqeel Abbas
